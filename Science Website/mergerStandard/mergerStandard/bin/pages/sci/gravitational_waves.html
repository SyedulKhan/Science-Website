            <p>Although Albert Einstein often gets recognition for predicting gravitational waves based on his renouned theories of relativity and fields, the possibility was in fact previously discussed by Oliver Heavside as far back as 1893<sup><a href="#grav_ref02b" id="grav_ref02a" class="Reference">[2]</a></sup>. 
            Another mention of note is Henri Poincaré, in 1905, who first proposed gravitational waves emanating from a body and propogating at the speed of light. Only later in 1916 did Einstein predict gravitational waves that transport energy as gravitational radiation. </p>
            <p>On 11<sup>th</sup> February 2016, The LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) announced they had detected gravitational waves.</p>

            <p>
                The principle behind Newtonain gravity is that each body of matter has a gravitational property proportional to its mass, an effect of this property is that bodies of matter are drawn to it. The closer the matter is the stronger the affect of its gravity.
            </p><p>Einstein&apos;s theory adds that the effects of gravity results from the matter&apos;s affect on the curvature of spacetime, the higher the mass, the greater the curvature and the greater the curvature the greater the gravity. Accelerating objects can generate changes in the curvature of space time, a good analogy would be the waves on water created by the wake of a boat. From properties of the waves such as the frequency and amplitude, it is possible to tell the amount of distortion caused by the object allowing us to calculate its size and mass.</p>

            <p>Research into the theory has been carried out by many notable scientists over the years, but the first gravitational waves to be detected were by The LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) 14<sup>th</sup> September 2015 (to be later announced on 11<sup>th</sup> February 2016). They have continued to detect additional gravitational waves.</p>

            Implications

        <article class="SciSectionText">
            <p>While previously having a view of the universe limited to objects emitting electromagnetic radiation that were not travelling away from earth at the speed of light, the detection of gravitational waves allows observers to recieve metrics from billions of years in the past, billions of lightyears away!</p>
            <p>This will undoubtedly further our knowledge of our universe and the theoretical spacial occurences that have previously been out of our reach. On a personal note, I suspect that this closer look at the theories of gravity may potentially result in a significant furthering of multi-dimensional theories, hopefully including what other effects the supposedly weakest of the fundamental forces maybe having outside our of perceivable dimensions.</p>
