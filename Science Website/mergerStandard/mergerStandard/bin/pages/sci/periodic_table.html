            Every single element has a specified position in the periodic table as seen in the image above.
            One of the most iconic periodic tables was produced by a scientist from Russia named Dmitri Mendeleev
            back in the 19th century. His ideas of the elements have been used throughout the modern era and the ideas
            include the following list:
        </p>
        <ul class="pTable_Pattern">
            <li>All the elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number</li>
            <li>The horizontal rows are known as periods</li>
            <li>The vertical columns are known as groups</li>
            <li>Elements in the same group have similar chemical properties</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            All of the groups are numbered from 1 to 7 going in the direction from left to right. However, the final group on
            the right is numbered as 0.
            The middle section of the table are known as the Transition Metals.
            The boundary (zig-zag) as well as the different colours separate the metals (left) from the non-metals (right).
            Hydrogen is also classified as a non-metal but it is placed on the top left according to the atomic number.
            Each and every element in the periodic table is associated with a chemical symbol in the form of letters.

                <h3 class="pTable_Title">Making predictions using the periodic table</h3>
                <p>
                    As mentioned before, every group in the periodic table contains elements with similar chemical properties.
                    We can use these similarities in each group to identify more about what they have in common as well as make predictions
                    when undertaking chemical experiments. The table, showing group one elements, below exemplifies of how can make predictions
                    for different properties
                </p>

                    <tr>
                        <th>Rubidium</th>
                        <td>Decreases further and further</td>
                        <td>Increases further and further</td>
                        <td>Increases further and further</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <!--This table contains chemical properties of group 1 elements-->
                <p>
                    The next element in the group is called Caesium which is below the element Rubidium.
                    Caesium is the next element in group 1, and it can be found below rubidium.
                    We can predict that Caesium's melting point will decrease even more than the other elements before it, its density
                    will increase even further than the other elements and its reactivity will also increase more.
