        I have worked part time for an Indian takeaway working in administration, taking customer orders and dealing with complaints.
        I spoke to customers on a daily basis and placed the orders that they wanted. I spoke to customers in a positive manner and enjoyed
        my time there. I also had a supervisory role, making sure that stock was continuously checked and had to ensure that each order was
        provided properly so that customers would be satisfied with what they receive.

        My interests and social activities are vital in creating my personal ethic and wellbeing. I like to do extra reading to advance my knowledge
        as well as improve my language skills. Studying A levels has created a more positive attitude to society for me and has shown me that the world
        of work is a world of hardship. I have received mentoring from mentors in Rothschild bank which enhanced my provisional and communicational skills.
        My strongest asset is my communication skills with people.

        I was also a member of the Tower Hamlets Metropolitan police cadets unit, training on how to be an officer and learning what goes on in a
        police officer’s daily career. Previously I was also awarded the Jack Petchey Foundation for outstanding achievement.
