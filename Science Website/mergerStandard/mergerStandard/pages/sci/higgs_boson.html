                Back in the 1970s, scientists and researchers realised that there are
                correlations between two of the four fundamental forces; the electromagnetic
                force and the weak force. Those two forces were analysed into theory and formed
                the grounds of the Standard Model. This Model belongs to particle physics, a field
                driven by physicists dedicated to breaking down the endlessly complicated
                universe to its most fundamental building blocks. The relationship between the
                electromagnetic and weak force implied that electricity, magnetism, light and some
                types of radioactivity are all manifestations of a single underlying force known
                as the electroweak force.
            </p>
            <p>
                The equations and theorems that described this force and its particles, the
                photon and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_and_Z_bosons" target="_blank" class="Reference">W and Z bosons</a>, were all correct apart from a big problem; all
                these particles emerged without a mass. Now that would not be a problem for the
                photon, but the W and Z have mass. This is where theoretical physicists
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Brout" target="_blank" class="Reference">Robert
                Brout</a>, 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Englert" target="_blank" class="Reference">Francois Englert</a> 
                and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Higgs" target="_blank" class="Reference">Peter Higgs</a> came in to solve this problem. They
                suggested a mechanism, which took the name Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism
                afterwards, that gives a mass to the W and Z when they interact with an invisible
                field, now called the Higgs field, which fills the universe. The Higgs Field,
                like most fundamental fields, should have an associated particle – the Higgs
                boson. That boson, when found, would be a visible manifestation of the Higgs
                field.

                To implement and put in practise all these years of questioning, reasoning and
                theorems, a colossal source of experimental energy should exist to make such goals
                even observable.  For this reason, but for many other as well, the famous Large Hadron
                Collider was built. For those that have not heard of it, Large Hadron Collider is a
                particle collider built by <acronym title="European Organization for Nuclear Research">CERN</acronym>. To construct this, it took 10 years and 10.000
                scientists and engineers. Hence, one could argue that <acronym title="Large Hadron Collider">LHC</acronym> is the most complex and
                sophisticated experimental facility ever built.
            </p>
            <p>
                The collider is equipped with superconducting magnets and accelerating structures
                that are required to boost the speed of the colliding particles. In order to avoid
                the loss of energy and achieve minimal electrical resistance these magnets need to
                be cooled down to -271.3&deg;C and for that reason the <acronym title="Large Hadron Collider">LHC</acronym> is being
                supplied with liquid helium. The accelerator contains two pipes; each is filled with
                high-energy particle beams that are being accelerated in opposite directions until
                they reach a speed that is close to that of the speed of light. Making that happen
                requires keeping those two pipes at ultrahigh vacuum. Then the two beams, being under
                control, are made to collide.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many experiments were conducted with no desired outcome throughout the starting years
                of <acronym title="Large Hadron Collider">LHC's</acronym> function, but the scientists that work there reported helpful evidence
                every time.

                On the 4<sup>th</sup> of July 2012, two experiments that were being conducted at 
                <acronym title="European Organization for Nuclear Research">CERN’s</acronym>
                <acronym title="Large Hadron Collider">LHC</acronym>
                announced they had each observed a new particle that possesses a mass of approximately
                126 giga-electron volts (1 GeV = 1 billion electron volts). This particle consisted
                with the Higgs boson that was predicted by the Standard Model.
            </p>
            <p>
                A year later, Francois Englert and Peter Higgs were awarded with the Nobel prize in
                physics for their theoretical work that contributed in understanding the origin of
                mass of subatomic particles. You can see the nomination video

                There are researchers that argue that even though the Higgs boson that was discovered
                back in 2012 may indeed look like what they were looking for, it is not exactly that.
                Looking back to our history we have seen cases that theories became realities and
                remain so but we have also witnessed cases that theories were made into beliefs that
                lasted centuries and afterwards were disproved. The latter case though, was not caused
                by misguidance but because of insufficient evidence paired together with the
                non-perishable impatience of the humankind. In which categories of the two does the
                Higgs discovery belong to? Only a few might be able to really tell but even so it is
                too early to say. Not to mention that there are many other theorems related to Higgs
                boson that are waiting to be tested upon in <acronym title="Large Hadron Collider">LHC</acronym>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finding such a particle or any particle for that
                matter is like a person that clapped too early in a special event; at that moment,
                nobody knows if it was the right action but that single clap could result to the
                whole audience clapping. Higgs boson or not, the people that are pursuing and devoting
                their lives to this, certainly deserve our gratitude for trying to solve one of the
                biggest questions of humankind.
